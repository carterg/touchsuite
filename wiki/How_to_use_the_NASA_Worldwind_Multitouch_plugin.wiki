= Instructions =

== Building the TouchlibCOMwrapper ==
  # [http://www.multigesture.net/articles/touchlib-compiling-instructions/ Compile touchlib]
  # Use TortoiseSVN to do a checkout of http://touchsuite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Csharp/
  # Open up TouchlibCOMwrapper.sln in the TouchlibCOMwrapper directory.
  # Press ALT-F7 to open up the project properties.
  # Set configuration to Release.
  # Go to C/C++ > General and open up "Additional Include Directories".
  # Replace "$(SolutionDir)/../touchlib/include" with the path to your touchlib include directory.
  # Go to Linker > General and open up "Additional Library Directories".
  # Replace "$(SolutionDir)/../touchlib/lib" with the path to your touchlib lib directory.
  # Click OK.
  # Set the project mode to release mode and press F7 (Build solution).
  # In the directory "Csharp\TouchlibCOMwrapper\release" there should be a file TouchlibCOMwrapper.lib and TouchlibCOMwrapper.dll. We will need these files later on.

== Register the TouchlibCOMwrapper ==
  # I have included a compiled build of TouchlibCOMwrapper.idl, if you need to recompile it, please read the instructions in readme_COM.txt
  # To register the wrapper double click the following batch file: RegisterTouchlibCOMwrapper(tlb).bat.
  # If you don't register this file, you will not be able to add a reference to this wrapper to the C# project.

== Compiling NASA World Wind and the Multitouch plug-in ==
  # Use [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-zip] to decompress World_Wind_1.4.0_Source.7z (directory: Csharp\Nasa_World_Wind_plugin ).
  # Put Multitouch.cs in \World_Wind_1.4.0_Source\WorldWind\
  # Open WorldWind.sln
  # Add the file to the project "WorldWind" in the solution explorer
  # Make sure that the wrapper library is installed (if you haven't already done it, run RegisterTouchlibCOMwrapper(tlb).bat once)
  # Add a reference to the TouchlibCOMwrapper.tlb (which is located in the TouchlibCOMwrapper directory)
  # Build the application.
  # Copy over all touchlib dll and touchlib config files, and also copy TouchlibCOMwrapper.dll to the bin dir of NWW.
  # Run NWW
  # Load the plugin from the plugin window

== Using the Multitouch plug-in in NASA World Wind ==
  # Todo
  # Press play ;)

= Known issues =
  * Currently you can only load the plugin once. Unloading and loading the plugin again will not work. You will need to restart NASA World Wind.
